A site sketch depicting site features is included as Figure 2. As indicated in the plan, CHES Field service representatives responded to the release on June 7, 2024. A CHES LSP also responded to examine the spill area. Release notification to MassDEP and the local Fire Department was completed and representatives from these agencies visited the site. A meeting with the regulators, CHES and the customer and construction contractor (Shawmut Construction) took place to review site conditions, site features and planned response actions. Information obtained indicated that the fuel entered the subsurface from the valve that sat above a void in the concrete pad. The void allowed the oil to impact the subsurface gravel placed during the 1st stage of concrete pad construction. Utilities proximate to the pad were to the east and included subsurface electrical conduit and a storm drain line. These features were approximately 2 to 3 feet and five feet below grade. A infiltration structure was situated east of these features which is designed to accept roof drainage from precipitation events. The bottom of the infiltration structure is approximately 7 feet below grade level. During the initial response, field screening was completed of the stained gravel with a PID and a detection of 30 ppm was noted. Screening of the drain line catch basin to the north and Town storm drainage along Hardy Street with the PID revealed no detections. In addition, the infiltration structure was designed with an overflow that was accessed via a manhole. The overflow discharges to the Town stormwater system along Hardy Street. Screening of this structure was 1.1 ppm . No sheen or evidence of product was noted on a small puddle of water in the bottom of this structure. The infiltration system contains an infiltration bypass then when activated directs roof drainage to the local storm sewer bypassing the infiltration structure. Shawmut reported that the bypass was being utilized, thus the infiltration system was not in use after the release. The infiltration system was in use up until the discovery of the release on June 7. During the initial response, a plan for a response action was discussed and ultimately implemented including subsurface assessment, impacted soil excavation necessitating generator and pad removal, boom placement at Morses pond with The Hardy Street storm drains discharge and product recovery from the subsurface ( where feasible).

The data, including the recovery and replacement of sorbent filter socks that were placed in the wells, demonstrated a substantial decline in the volume of LNAPL at the site. Based on this observation, gauging events were reduced to every two weeks in November followed by monthly gauging events in December, January and February. This information has been summarized in Table 2. With no measurable LNAPL present in the January and February monitoring events, the decision was made to discontinue the periodic gauging until April. Filter socks were left in wells that had a history of LNAPL presence, and those socks will be recovered at the end of April. 4.2 Quarterly Groundwater Sampling Quarterly Groundwater Monitoring events were conducted on December 2, 2024 and again on February 18, 2025. During each event, the field personnel measured the static depth to groundwater before purging the wells of a minimum of three well volumes. In addition, CHES personnel conducted low-flow groundwater purging and sampling of 3 monitoring wells during these events to monitor field specific data of parameters that provide information on the natural attenuation and biodegradation of the petroleum. There is an abundance of literature that demonstrates that dissolved petroleum releases are acted upon by bacteria that are naturally occurring in the environment. When there are naturally occurring bacteria present in the aquifer that are actively degrading/consuming the petroleum, the geochemistry of the groundwater is slightly altered by the activity. Using low-flow sample techniques and monitoring for data such as dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and the oxidation/reduction potential (ORP), it is possible to identify zones of activity where aerobic activity is occurring. The field parameters measured on December 2, 2024 indicated that groundwater in the vicinity of monitoring wells MW-15 and MW-25 had an abundance of DO available (greater than 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L respectively) in areas where no dissolved petroleum was found in the laboratory samples. Additionally, these two wells were observed to have ORP values greater than 120 mV which also indicates an area with little to no petroleum present for aerobic bacteria to consume. However, the data collected from well MW-17 which was reported to have minimal concentrations of dissolved petroleum compounds present, the DO values were lower in the range of 1 to 1.5 mg/L. This is evidence that the aerobic bacterial present near well MW-17 were using available oxygen during the degradation of the minor amount of dissolved petroleum in that area. When the field measurements were repeated in wells MW-16, MW-17 and well MW-25 on February 18, 2025 it was found that the DO levels in well MW-17 had lowered even more to around 1.07 mg/L and the ORP values had dropped from positive values to -36.5. This data correlated with the slight increase in dissolved petroleum compounds reported as detected in the sample submitted for laboratory analysis. Data from wells MW-16 and MW-25 demonstrate that the aquifer around the dissolved plume continues to have an abundance of available DO and elevated ORP readings typical of water with no dissolved petroleum contamination. 4.2 Evaluation of Aquifer Parameters",120_day_status_report_sample,"Diesel Release Wellesley, MA 120 Day IRA Status RTN No.: 3-0050297 Page 4 of 9 4.1 LNAPL/GW Gauging CHES personnel continued to conduct weekly gauging of wells for light, non-aqueous petroleum layer (LNAPL) thickness on top of the groundwater and groundwater elevation data throughout October.

However, once the excavation attained the depth of the groundwater, the flow rates were lower than anticipated on a daily basis to keep the groundwater out of the excavation area. Based on this, additional investigations into the nature of the aquifer were conducted to better refine the Conceptual Site Model. 4.2.1 Grain Size Analysis During advancement of soil borings in August 2024, samples of soil collected from B-15/MW-15, B-16/MW-16, B-17/MW-17, B-18/MW-18 and B-20/MW-20 were submitted for analysis of grain size. This analysis reported that the soil from B-15/MW-15 and B-16/MW-16 contained 89% and 71% respectively of material in the fines category passing through the 200 sieve. The other three soil samples had 7%, 5% and 3% fines respectively. The higher percentage of fine grain material in the first two soil borings are indicative of an aquifer that would have relatively low hydraulic conductivity and lower groundwater velocity in comparison to the three samples with larger grain soil. During the drilling on September 27, 2024 some additional soil samples were collected for grain size analysis when advancing borings B-24/MW-24, B-25/MW-25 and B-26/MW-26. The soil samples from these borings showed similar grain size distribution as B-17/MW-17, B-18/MW-18 and B-20/MW-20 with larger material and a smaller percentage of fines present. The results of laboratory testing for grain size analysis have been summarized in Table 3. 4.2.2 Groundwater Elevation and Gradient Another line of evidence relative to the hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer can be associated with the gradient of the groundwater at a disposal site. A generalized evaluation of the gradient will typically show a steeper gradient (i.e. larger change in elevation over a set distance) in aquifers with lower hydraulic conductivity. Whereas an aquifer with higher hydraulic conductivity typically exhibits a lower gradient because the water can move through the material with less resistance. The groundwater elevation data for this site correlates with this observed change in hydraulic conductivity. The gradient is relatively steep in the portion of the disposal site that has finer grained soil and a lower hydraulic conductivity. When the groundwater reaches the portion of the aquifer with coarse grained soil, the gradient becomes nearly flat. The groundwater elevation data from the December 2024 gauging event are provided on Figure 2. 4.2.3 Low Flow Drawdown Analysis of Hydraulic Conductivity During the February 2025 groundwater sampling event, CHES field inspectors conducted low flow groundwater sampling in monitoring wells MW-16, MW-17 and MW-25. One of the objectives of the low flow analysis was to try and obtain stabilized drawdown data at three different pumping flow rates on each of the wells. This mini step drawdown test was a tool for aquifer testing that was proposed by Garry Robbins at the University of Connecticut at Storrs and Rams Horn Educational as part of the rapid site characterization methods.

The results of this testing are summarized in Table 3 attached to this report and the laboratory analytical reports are provided in Appendix C. The overall trend of the guarterly groundwater monitoring demonstrates that the dissolved petroleum plume is contained to an area northwest of the limits of excavation conducted last summer. The dissolved plume is surrounded by wells that were reported to have no dissolved contaminants present, and the plume is exhibiting characteristics of a stable plume or diminishing plume at this point. 4.4 Assessment for Condition of Substantial Release Migration (310 CMR 40.0006) As part of all IRAs, an assessment must be completed to determine whether a Substantial Release Migration, Critical Exposure Pathway, or Imminent Hazard is present. A Substantial Release Migration (SRM) means any of the following conditions: releases that have resulted in the discharge of separate-phase oil and/or separate-phase hazardous material to surface waters, subsurface structures, or underground utilities or conduits; releases to the ground surface or to the vadose zone that, if not promptly removed or contained, are likely to significantly impact the underlying groundwater, or significantly exacerbate an existing condition of groundwater pollution; releases to the groundwater that have migrated or are expected to migrate more than 200 feet per year; releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a public or private water supply well; releases to the groundwater that have been or are within one year likely to be detected in a surface water body, wetland, or public water supply reservoir; or releases to the groundwater or to the vadose zone that have resulted or are within one year likely to result in the discharge of vapors into school buildings or occupied residential dwellings. The diesel fuel that was released has impacted the groundwater beneath the property. This area is in a Zone II.

10,"Diesel Release Wellesley, MA 120 Day IRA Status RTN No.: 3-0050297 Page 8 of 9 An Imminent Hazard would be: a release to the environment which, results in the presence of oil and/or hazardous material vapors within buildings, structures, or underground utility conduits at a concentration equal to or greater than 10% of the Lower Explosive Limit; this condition is believed to be absent. a release to the environment of reactive or explosive hazardous material, as described in 310 CMR 40.0347, which threatens human health or safety; is believed to be absent. a release to a roadway that endangers public safety; this condition is absent. a release to the environment of oil and/or hazardous material which poses a significant risk to human health when present for even a short period of time, as specified in 310 CMR 40.0950; this condition is believed to be absent. a release to the environment which produces readily apparent effects to human health, including respiratory distress or dermal irritation; this condition is believed to be absent. a release to the environment of oil and/or hazardous material which produces immediate or acute adverse impacts to freshwater or saltwater fish populations; this condition is believed to be absent. Based upon the data received, an imminent hazard is not currently present and further response actions are planned to mitigate site conditions. 4.7 LNAPL Conceptual Site Model The LNAPL Conceptual Site Model (CSM) is currently described as follows: The source of the LNAPL was a sudden release of approximately 775 gallons of diesel that had been placed in a newly installed generator as part of a new school construction project. The source of the release was a defective component of the generator that allowed the contents of the tank to drain by gravity under the generator. While the generator was set on a concrete pad for stability, there was an opening in the concrete pad beneath the generator for the conduits that supplied the electricity to the building. Those conduits were placed in a porous stone backfill material that allowed the diesel to migrate easily through the stone into the subsurface where the relatively porous near surface soils allowed for rapid vertical migration to the water table at a depth of approximately 10 to 11 feet below the surface. Upon excavation of the soils above the water table, an LNAPL layer was visible at the air/water interface beneath the generator. Initial subsurface borings and monitoring wells established near the release documented a layer of LNAPL extending west and northwest of the release. Excavation of the impacted soil into the top two feet of the affected aquifer during initial Immediate Response Action activities mitigated a large amount of the contaminant mass within the first two months post release. Subsequent monitoring for LNAPL in the monitoring well network was accompanied by additional LNAPL recovery efforts including vacuum removal, bailing and sorbent sock removal. Investigatory data indicates that there are two distinct aquifer areas within the disposal site boundary; one area closest to the release consists of predominantly silts and clays with relatively low hydraulic conductivity in the 10-4 cm/sec range that transitions to an area of larger grain size with hydraulic conductivity in the 10-2 cm/sec range.

To achieve CAM compliance for MCP data, ESS Laboratory has reviewed all QA/QC Requirements and Performance Standards listed in each method. Holding times and preservation have also been reviewed. All CAM requirements have been performed and achieved unless noted in the project narrative. Each method has been set-up in the laboratory to reach required MCP standards. The methods for aqueous VOA and Soil Methanol VOA have known limitations for certain analytes. The regulatory standards may not be achieved due to these limitations. In addition, for all methods, matrix interferences, dilutions, and %Solids may elevate method reporting limits above regulatory standards. ESS Laboratory can provide, upon request, a Limit Checker (regulatory standard comparison spreadsheet) electronic deliverable which will highlight these exceedances. Question I: All samples for EPH were analyzed for a subset of the required MCP list per the client's request.

These results are only representative of sample aliquots received at the laboratory. ESS Laboratory expects its clients to follow all regulatory sampling guidelines. Beginning with this page, the entire report has been paginated. This report should not be copied except in full without the approval of the laboratory. Samples will be disposed of thirty days after the final report has been delivered. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call our Customer Service Department. Laurel Stoddard Laboratory Director Analytical Summary The project as described above has been analyzed in accordance with the ESS Quality Assurance Plan. This plan utilizes the following methodologies: US EPA SW-846, US EPA Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes per 40 CFR Part 136, APHA Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and other recognized methodologies. The analyses with these noted observations are in conformance to the Quality Assurance Plan. In chromatographic analysis, manual integration is frequently used instead of automated integration because it produces more accurate results. The test results present in this report are in compliance with TNI and relative state standards, and/or client Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP). The laboratory has reviewed the following: Sample Preservations, Hold Times, Initial Calibrations, Continuing Calibrations, Method Blanks, Blank Spikes, Blank Spike Duplicates, Duplicates, Matrix Spikes, Matrix Spike Duplicates, Surrogates and Internal Standards. Any results which were found to be outside of the recommended ranges stated in our SOPs will be noted in the Project Narrative.

To achieve CAM compliance for MCP data, ESS Laboratory has reviewed all QA/QC Requirements and Performance Standards listed in each method. Holding times and preservation have also been reviewed. All CAM requirements have been performed and achieved unless noted in the project narrative. Each method has been set-up in the laboratory to reach required MCP standards. The methods for aqueous VOA and Soil Methanol VOA have known limitations for certain analytes. The regulatory standards may not be achieved due to these limitations. In addition, for all methods, matrix interferences, dilutions, and %Solids may elevate method reporting limits above regulatory standards. ESS Laboratory can provide, upon request, a Limit Checker (regulatory standard comparison spreadsheet) electronic deliverable which will highlight these exceedances.
